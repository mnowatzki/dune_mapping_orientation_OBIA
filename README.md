# dune_mapping_orientation_OBIA
Python scripts that are part of a framework to map dunefields and quantify their orientation.

The Google Earth Engine scripts and data used to map dunefields, i.e. classify ar region into dune vs non-dune areas, can be found here: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/mnowatzki/MScTHESIS_Nowatzki
We provide a set of functions (dunefield_OBIA_modules) as well as scripts and data for the analysis of two dunefields in the Ili-Balkhash area (Zhalkum and Abdulkum). These can be customised and used to analyse other areas.
